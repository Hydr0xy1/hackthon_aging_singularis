INTRODUCTION: Polycystic ovarian syndrome
(PCOS), a prevalent reproductive endocrine disorder affecting 10 to 13% of women in their reproductive age, is characterized by hyperandrogenemia, ovulatory dysfunction, polycystic ovarian morphology, and often by associated metabolic disorders. Androgen excess is a key factor driving the phenotypic features of PCOS.
Despite the high prevalence of PCOS, pharmasyndrome encounter substantial challenges.

RATIONALE: Artemisinin, derived from Artemisia plants, is widely recognized for its efficacy against malaria. We have previously demonpossess the capability to enhance energy exactivation of thermogenic adipocytes, thereby protecting against diet-induced obesity and metabolic disorders. In this study, we explored rodent PCOS-like models and human patients with PCOS by evaluating the effect of artemisinin derivatives on testosterone level, estrous cycle, and polycystic ovarian morphology. Using in vitro and in vivo approaches, we investigated the impact of artemisinins on ovarian testosterone synthesis.

Artemisinins inhibit ovarian androgen synthesis and relieve PCOS. The pro-androgen inducer human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) disrupts the interaction between LONP1 and CYP11A1, leading to the upregulation of CYP11A1, which promotes androgen production and exacerbates PCOS. Conversely, artemisinins mediate LONP1-CYP11A1 interaction, promoting the degradation of CYP11A1 and subsequently inhibiting ovarian androgen synthesis. Consequently, artemisinins show efficacy in ameliorating PCOS symptoms in both rodents and human patients [Figure created with BioRender.com].

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a prevalent reproductive disorder in women of reproductive age, features androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries. Despite its high prevalence, specific pharmacologic intervention for PCOS is challenging. In this study, we identified artemisinins as anti-PCOS agents. Our finding demonstrated the efficacy of artemisinin derivatives in alleviating PCOS symptoms in both rodent models and human patients, curbing hyperandrogenemia through suppression of ovarian androgen synthesis. Artemisinins promoted cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamily A member 1 (CYP11A1) protein degradation to block androgen overproduction.
Mechanistically, artemisinins directly targeted lon peptidase 1 (LONP1), enhanced LONP1-CYP11A1 interaction, and facilitated LONP1-catalyzed CYP11A1 degradation. Overexpression of LONP1 replicated the androgen-lowering effect of artemisinins. Our data suggest that artemisinin application is a promising approach for treating PCOS and highlight the crucial role of the LONP1-CYP11A1 interaction in controlling hyperandrogenism and PCOS occurrence.
olycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a complicated reproductive-metabolic disreproductive age, with a prevalence of
10 to 13% (1–4). It encompasses diverse clinical symptoms, including hyperandrogenism, oligoovulation or anovulation, polycystic ovaries,
and in many cases, metabolic disorders (5–8).
phenotypic features of PCOS, such as follicular dysplasia, impaired ovulation, endometrial diseases, and metabolic dysfunction (9). In addition, prenatal androgen exposure induces
PCOS-like traits in female offspring, heightPCOS (10). Consequently, controlling androgen excess is crucial to PCOS intervention.
In women, androgens are primarily synthesized by the adrenal glands and ovaries. These cytochromes P450 (CYP) and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD), including CYP family 11 subfamily A member 1 (CYP11A1), CYP17A1,
HSD3B2, and HSD17B (11, 12). Within the ovary,
androstenedione and testosterone are predomdiffuse into granulosa cells, where they are converted into estrogen by aromatase (CYP19A1)
(11). Ovarian steroidogenesis is highly responsive
(LH) or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).
Numerous studies have demonstrated an increaseintheexpressionof CYP11A1and CYP17A1,
as well as elevated enzyme activity of CYP17A1,
HSD3B, and HSD17B in the ovarian theca cells of PCOS, resulting in elevated production of progesterone, 17a-hydroxyprogesterone (17aOHP), and testosterone (13–16). Therefore, insteroidogenesis-related enzymes may be efCurrently, pharmacologic interventions for specific symptoms. Few available drugs effectively target all aspects of PCOS. Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are recommended for managing hyperandrogenism and/or irregPCOS. However, COCs do not improve infertility and polycystic ovary morphology. Moreover, COCs are often associated with side
(17), which limit their long-term clinical application, particularly for PCOS patients with metabolic disorders. Artemisinin, a molecule isolated from Artemisia plants, exerts an antimalarial effect (18). We have previously demonstrated that artemisinin and its derivatives,
including artemether (ATM), artesunate (ATS),
and SM934, can promote energy expenditures and insulin sensitivity by activating thermogenic adipocytes (19), thereby protecting against high-fat diet–induced obesity and metabolic disorders. In this study, artemisinins were
PCOS because they strongly inhibited ovarian androgen synthesis, reduced immature follicles, and improved the estrous cycle in both
PCOS rodent models and patients.

B). When administered simultaneously, ATM
DHEA-treated mice, thereby preventing PCOSlike traits (Fig. 1C). The disrupted estrous cycle caused by DHEA was improved by ATM (Fig.
1D). Ovaries from PCOS-like mice exhibited increased numbers of cyst-like follicles and corpus luteum, whereas the ovaries of ATMovarian follicles at different stages of development (Fig. 1E). Metabolic measurements revealed that ATM had no effect on body weight,
fat mass, lean mass, hepatic steatosis, and glucose tolerance (fig. S1, A to D). ATM demsensitivity in DHEA-treated mice (fig. S1E),

(TG) in DHEA-induced mice (fig. S1F) but had no effect on total cholesterol (TC) and glucose levels (fig. S1, G and H). Additionally, ATM was safe, with no liver toxicity as indicated by unchanged alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels (fig. S1I).
Building upon the observed preventive effect, the therapeutic effects of ATM were assessed. After establishment of a DHEA-induced
PCOS-like model, mice were treated with varyinjections (Fig. 1F). ATM dose-dependently decreased serum testosterone (Fig. 1G), recovered normal estrous cycles (Fig. 1H), inhibited uterus edema (Fig. 1I), and dramatically reduced cystic follicles in the ovaries (Fig. 1J).

2B) and to alleviate the disrupted estrous cycles (Fig. 2C). Ovarian histological analysis revealed that ATM reversed the oligo-ovulatory phenotype in DHEA-treated rats, as indicated and a decrease in cyst-like follicles (Fig. 2D).
Similarly, oral administration of ATM also repressed PCOS-like manifestations in the rat model (fig. S2, A to C).
The findings were further validated in another PCOS-like rat model established by insulin and hCG injections (Fig. 2E), both of which are robust inducers of androgen production.

artemisinins in modulating androgen synthesis. The hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary axis plays production (20). Therefore, we initially determined follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
and LH, which are upstream hormones controlling the synthesis of steroid hormones, including progesterone, androgens, and estrogen
(20). ATM displayed no impact on FSH and
LH, whether administered intraperitoneally or orally in the PCOS-like models (fig. S3, A to F), implying that gonadotropin generation might remain unaltered by ATM. We therefore hypothesized that artemisinins regulated testosterone levels by targeting the ovary. To assess this, we measured steroid hormones in the supernatant of isolated ovarian thecainterstitial cells, which are a major source of with PCOS (Fig. 3A) (11). ATM significantly
(1 mM versus 0 mM, P = 0.0298; 5 mM versus
0, P = 0.0011; 10 mM versus 0, P = 0.0007)
inhibited testosterone production in thecainterstitial cells in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 3B). Similarly, SM934, also an artemisinin analog (21), showed inhibitory effects on tesby ATM (Fig. 3C). In addition to reducing testosterone, ATM and SM934 also obviously reduced pregnenolone, progesterone, and 17a-OHP,
steroidogenesis and the precursors of testosterone (Fig. 3, D to I). This observation was derivative, artesunate (ATS), which likewise dose-dependently suppressed pregnenolone,
progesterone, and 17a-OHP (fig. S4, A to C).
Moreover, this inhibitory effect was not due impair the viability of theca-interstitial cells (fig.
S5, A and B). These data strongly suggested ovarian theca-interstitial cells.
Adipose tissue prominently expresses aldoketoreductase type 1C3 (AKR1C3), converting androstenedione (A4) to testosterone (22, 23).
In conditions such as PCOS or obesity, elevated
AKR1C3 in subcutaneous fat, possibly induced by increased insulin, endows adipose tissue
(22, 23). However, ATM did not affect testosthe basal state and under insulin or A4 treatment (fig. S5C). Similarly, ATM showed no adipocytes (fig. S5D). Consistently, testosterone unchanged by ATM treatment (fig. S5E).
reducing CYP11A1 for the decrease in androgen synthesis induced by artemisinins, we conducted mass spectrometry–based relative quantitative proteomics analysis on isolated theca-interstitial cells with or without ATM treatment. CYP11A1 was the most significantly (P = 0.00000533)
down-regulated protein induced by ATM (Fig.
3J). CYP11A1 catalyzes the conversion from cholesterol to pregnenolone, which is the initial step of steroid hormone biosynthesis (12).
The down-regulation of CYP11A1 by ATM costep, as evidenced by the decreased pregnenolone (Fig. 3D and G). To validate the proteomics data, we detected the expression of steroidogenic enzymes in theca-interstitial cells from mice and rats, with the results that artemisinins dose-dependently down-regulated
CYP11A1 protein (Fig. 3K and fig. S6, A to C),
whereas they did not affect HSD3B2 and
CYP17A1 (Fig. 3K). The decline in CYP11A1 protein initiated at the 8th-hour post-ATM treatment (fig. S6D). Consistently, CYP11A1 proteins were dramatically reduced by ATM in the ovaries of PCOS-like mice (Fig. 3L). Furthermore,
CYP11A1 was also down-regulated by artemisinins in human BeWo choriocarcinoma cells, which are human placenta–derived and cansynthesize steroid hormones (fig. S6E). ATM treatment did
(StAR) protein (fig. S6F), which is essential for steroid hormone formation (24).
Next, we proceeded to elucidate whether the decrease in CYP11A1 mediated the inhibsynthesis. First, we supplemented artemisinin-treated theca-interstitial cells with pregnenolone, which is the product of CYP11A1 catalytic reaction and reduced by artemisinins (Fig. 3A), with the results that pregnenthe decreased progesterone, 17a-OHP, and testosterone induced by artemisinins (Fig. 3M).
We then manipulated the expression of CYP11A1 and found that overexpression of CYP11A1 artemisinin-treating cells (Fig. 3N). When
CYP11A1 expression was disrupted, artemisinins were unable to further reduce the production of progesterone, 17a-OHP, and testosterone (Fig. 3O). These results together suggested that up-regulating and down-regulating CYP11A1 through CYP11A1.

and demonstrate antimalarial activity by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) (25), it the down-regulation of CYP11A1, because the
ROS inducer elesclomol had no detectable effect on CYP11A1 (fig. S7A). Consistently, ROSscavenger N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) did not affect the ATM-induced down-regulation of
CYP11A1 (fig. S7B). Additionally, despite the reduction in protein levels induced by artemisinins,
themRNAofCyp11a1inisolated theca-interstitial cells (fig. S7, C and D) or DHEA-induced ovaries (fig. S7, E and F) remained unaffected by artemisinins, indicating posttranscriptional regulation by artemisinins. Subsequently, we examined the stability of CYP11A1 and found that the half-life of CYP11A1 protein was obviously shortened by ATM and SM934 (Fig. 4A and fig.
S8A). Further study showed that the protease inhibitor MG132 rescued the down-regulation of CYP11A1 induced by ATM and SM934 (Fig.
4B and fig. S8B), which collectively indicated that artemisinins reduced CYP11A1 levels by repressing its protein stability.
artemisinin-induced instability of CYP11A1, we mass spectrometry (IP-MS) to identify the interacting partners of CYP11A1 under ATM or
SM934 treatment (Fig. 4C). On the basis of the
IP-MS data, we identified 8 proteins that interacted with CYP11A1 specifically under ATM treatment and 23 proteins that did so under
SM934 treatment. Among these proteins, two groups, namely lon peptidase 1 (LONP1) and trafficking from ER to Golgi regulator (TFG)
(Fig. 4C). LONP1 is an AAA+ mitochondrial protease and functions by utilizing ATP hydrolysis to degrade misfolded or oxidized proteins, which is crucial in protein quality control in mitochondria (26). TFG is a COPII vesiclerelated protein that regulates ER to Golgi transport (27). To validate the IP-MS results, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay by precipitating CYP11A1-Flag and found that interaction between LONP1 and CYP11A1 was dramatically enhanced by ATM and SM934 induction, although precipitated CYP11A1 in the artemisinin-treated group was even lower than in control, primarily because of down-regulated
CYP11A1 by artemisinin treatment (Fig. 4D).
By contrast, TFG-CYP11A1 interaction could be slightly augmented by ATM but not SM934
(fig. S9A). Subsequent investigations revealed that LONP1 overexpression dramatically downregulated CYP11A1 (fig. S9B), whereas TFG had no effect on it (fig. S9C). These data together suggested that LONP1 but not TFG might be

LONP1 and CYP11A1 that mediated their interaction. Protein-protein docking predicted that residues W56 to S66 or F252 to T259 in
CYP11A1 might serve as the binding site for
LONP1. We therefore generated mutant forms of CYP11A1 with deletion of either W56 to S66
(DW56-S66) or F252 to T259 (DF252-T259)
and found that DW56-S66 retained the ability to interact with LONP1, whereas DF252-T259 lost the capacity to bind to LONP1 (Fig. 4F),
suggesting that the region F252 to T259 in
CYP11A1 was essential for CYP11A1-LONP1 interaction. To define the domain in LONP1 responsible for binding to CYP11A1, we expressed the N-domain, adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) domain, and proteolytic domain of LONP1. Because LONP1 is a mitochondrial protein, we fused all the truncated domains
(MTS) of LONP1 to ensure their import into the mitochondria (Fig. 4G). Unexpectedly, all the domains of LONP1 exhibited strong interactions with CYP11A1, without domain selectivity (Fig. 4H).
LONP1 promotes CYP11A1 degradation and
Having established that artemisinins augmented CYP11A1-LONP1 interaction, we then sought to investigate the role of LONP1 in artemisinin-induced CYP11A1 degradation.
LONP1 overexpression reduced CYP11A1 levels,
which were rescued by MG132 (Fig. 5A), which
LONP1 (29). These results were in concert with the aforementioned data showing that MG132 could restore the decreased CYP11A1 caused by artemisinins (Fig. 4B). Additionally, the reduced CYP11A1 expression caused by ATM was reversed by the inhibitor of LONP1, methyl ester derivative of 2-cyano-3,12-dioxo-oleana1,9(11)-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO-Me) (30) (Fig.
5B). Knockdown of LONP1 in theca-interstitial
(siRNAs) completely reversed the decreased
CYP11A1 induced by ATM (Fig. 5C). In LONP1deficient cells, ATM had little effect on the down-regulation of CYP11A1 (Fig. 5C). By contrast, CYP17A1 remained unaffected by both
ATM and LONP1 (Fig. 5C). Subsequently, we generated catalytically inactive LONP1 (LONP1S844A) with an S844A (S844→A) substitution for protein degradation (31, 32). LONP1-S844A failed to diminish CYP11A1 expression (Fig.
5D) or shorten the half-life of CYP11A1 protein (Fig. 5E) like the WT LONP1 did, indicating that LONP1 decreased CYP11A1 through its protease activity. To confirm whether LONP1 directly mediated the down-regulation of
CYP11A1, we conducted in vitro protease assay using purified CYP11A1 and LONP1 proteins.
The presence of ATP was necessary for LONP1’s function. Our results showed that ATM promoted the LONP1-catalyzed degradation of
CYP11A1 (Fig. 5F), whereas in the absence of
LONP1 or ATP, ATM had no effect on CYP11A1
(Fig. 5F). The in vitro protease assay further confirmed that both ATM and SM934 accelerated LONP1-catalyzed degradation of CYP11A1
(Fig. 5G). Besides, the mutant form of CYP11A1
(DF252-T259), which failed to bind with LONP1,
exhibited resistance to the down-regulation induced by artemisinins (fig. S9, G and H).
indispensable role of LONP1 in mediating the reduction of CYP11A1 induced by artemisinins.
Additionally, we found that both LONP1 and
CYP11A1 were highly expressed in ovaries (fig.
S9I), and they are known to be localized in mitochondria (12, 33). The similar tissue disthe possibility that LONP1 could target CYP11A1 in response to artemisinin treatment.
In addition to LONP1, the ClpXP complex,
another important protease machinery in mitocontrol (34), was also examined for its involvement in regulating CYP11A1. ClpXP consists of two distinct components, an AAA+ ATPase
(34). Overexpression of both ClpP and ClpX had no impact on CYP11A1 protein (fig. S10A).
Additionally, no binding was observed between CYP11A1 and either ClpP or ClpX, and
(fig. S10B). These findings rule out the possibility of ClpXP in mediating CYP11A1 degradation.
Next, we assessed the impact of LONP1 on ovarian androgen synthesis. Adenovirusmediated overexpression of LONP1 in thecainterstitial cells or BeWo cells down-regulated
CYP11A1 protein (Fig. 5H and fig. S11A). As a consequence of decreased CYP11A1, the supernatant levels of pregnenolone, progesterone,
17a-OHP, and testosteronefrom theca-interstitial cells were considerably reduced by LONP1 overexpression (Fig. 5, I to L). Consistent with this,
overexpression of LONP1 in BeWo cells also yielded a reduction in steroidogenesis (fig. S11,
B and C). We also overexpressed LONP1 in adeno-associated virus (AAV)–LONP1, with the results that LONP1 reduced CYP11A1 (Fig. 5M)
and concomitantly inhibited the serum testosterone (Fig. 5N). These data together suggested that overexpression of LONP1 replicated the androgen-lowering effect of artemisinins.
Publicly available data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, accession no. GSE1615)
indicated that LONP1 expression levels in theca cells from PCOS patients were significantly (P =
0.0104) lower as compared with levels found in normal theca cells (Fig. 5O) (35), which was in line with the inhibitory effect of LONP1 on
CYP11A1 and androgen synthesis. We further examined the CYP11A1-LONP1 association in response to androgen inducers, such as hCG
(36). In contrast to the promoting effect of artemisinins on CYP11A1-LONP1 interaction,
hCG markedly disrupted their interaction (fig.
S12A). Consequently, hCG treatment promoted
CYP11A1 levels and reversed the decreased
CYP11A1 caused by LONP1 overexpression (fig.
S12B). Consistent with this result, CYP11A1 was elevated in the ovaries of the PCOS-like treatment (fig. S12C). Furthermore, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), one type of androgen, also recovered the decreased CYP11A1 caused by
LONP1 (fig. S12D). These data together indiassociation between LONP1 and CYP11A1, promoted CYP11A1 expression, and thus could aggravate androgen excess.

LONP1 is the direct target of artemisinins
We then sought to ascertain whether artemisinins directly targeted LONP1 or CYP11A1. To this end, biotin was conjugated to artesunate
(bio-ATS) for the pull-down assay (Fig. 6A). We confirmed that bio-ATS effectively reduced
CYP11A1 (fig. S13A), indicating that the biotin attachment did not affect the function of ATS.
Subsequently, we conducted a bio-ATS capture assay and found that bio-ATS exhibited binding affinity toward the LONP1 protein instead of CYP11A1 (Fig. 6B and fig. S13B). Preincubation with free ATS, ATM, or SM934 occupied LONP1 and disrupted the interaction between bio-ATS and LONP1 (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, the thermal stability assay provided artemisinins and LONP1 (Fig. 6C), supported

to its target, a protein structure–based docking calculation was carried out with a 2.51-Å resolution structure of LONP1 (PDB entry: 6WZV)
(37) by using Glide v8.1. Artemisinin derivative proteolyticdomainofLONP1(Fig.6D).Bortezomib is a known inhibitor of LONP1 (37). We observed that bortezomib augmented CYP11A1 levels and reversed the decreased CYP11A1 induced by LONP1 (fig. S13D). This finding led was accurate, bortezomib might compete with artemisinin for binding to LONP1. We therefore conducted a bio-ATS capture assay and disthe interaction between bio-ATS and LONP1 (fig.
S13E). In concert with the competition between
LONP1, bortezomib completely rescued the decreased CYP11A1 caused by artemisinins (fig.
S13F). Considering that the predicted bindthe proteolytic domain of LONP1, we prothe binding affinity of artemisinins to it. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) revealed that a dissociation constant (KD) of 3.11 ± 0.358 mM
(Fig. 6E), SM934 exhibited a binding affinity with a KD of 8.69 ± 0.749 mM (Fig. 6F), and
KD of 0.261 ± 0.029 mM (Fig. 6G). The interaction between proteolytic domain of LONP1 and CYP11A1 was augmented by artemisinin analog SM934 (Fig. 6H). We then generated a mutant form of LONP1 with a deletion of residues G847 to D852 (DGATPKD). These resiof LONP1-artemisinin binding, according to our docking data. The mutant DGATPKD LONP1 retained its capacity to interact with CYP11A1,
similarly to WT LONP1, but it conferred resistance to artemisinins, as indicated by the obserinteraction between DGATPKD LONP1 and
CYP11A1 (Fig. 6I). To functionally evaluate the contribution of the GATPKD motif of LONP1 to artemisinin-induced CYP11A1 degradation, we generated LONP1 knockout cells and reconstituted them with either WT LONP1 or the mutant
DGATPKD LONP1. Loss of LONP1 up-regulated
CYP11A1 compared with the results for control cells. Reconstitution with either WT or mutant
LONP1 successfully reversed the increased
CYP11A1, indicating that mutant LONP1 still preserveditsproteaseactivitytodegradeCYP11A1
(Fig. 6J). When these cells were treated with artemisinins, CYP11A1 was down-regulated in the
LONP1 knockout cells. Reintroduction of WT
LONP1 restored the inhibitory effect of artemisinins on CYP11A1, whereas reintroduction of mutant LONP1 failed to reverse the artemisinin-induced down-regulation of CYP11A1
(Fig. 6J), which could result primarily from the mutant LONP1’s inability to bind to artemisinins. It was worth noting that the GATPKD residues in LONP1 were highly conserved across different species (fig. S13G), supporting the obcells. Collectively, these data supported the on CYP11A1 level was largely dependent on its binding to the proteolytic domain of LONP1.
Lastly, we performed a pilot clinical study to patients with PCOS. Nineteen individuals with

62.1 ± 8.9 kg; body mass index (BMI): 23.23 ±

or amenorrhea, and polycystic ovary appearance before treatment. Dihydroartemisinin was well tolerated and no side effects were observed in any of the participants. Treatment with dihydroartemisinin significantly (P < 0.0001)

63.16% (12/19) of all patients with PCOS (Fig.
7D and fig. S14). Together, dihydroartemisinin effectively ameliorated the hyperandrogenemia, improved polycystic ovarian morphology,

Establishing an animal model that accurately mirrors PCOS in women is imperative.
Several rodent models for PCOS have been reported, encompassing androgen-induced models (utilizing testosterone, DHT, and DHEA),
estrogen-induced models, aromatase inhibitor–
induced models, transgenic rodent models,
and diet-induced models (49). Although the most reliable, none of these models fully replicates the complex conditions of PCOS in women (49). In this study, we used a peripubertal
DHEA model, displaying elevated serum testosterone levels, irregular estrous cycles, and polycystic ovarian morphology. However, this including hyperprolactinemia, such that it did not fully mirror PCOS features in women—a limitation in the current study. Nonetheless, we also used an hCG- and insulin-induced model of artemisinins on PCOS development.
LONP1 is a highly conserved multifuncquality control through preferentially degrading damaged, oxidized, or misfolded proteins,
folding in mitochondria (34, 50–53). Here, we uncovered a function of LONP1 in controlling androgen synthesis by targeting CYP11A1 in response to artemisinins. CYP11A1 was involved steroidogenesis, whereas CYP17A1, HSD3B2,
and StAR might not be. LONP1 and CYP11A1 shared similar tissue distribution patterns,
being abundantly expressed in theca-interstitial mitochondria (54). However, under normal conditions, CYP11A1 remained relatively stable because of its minimal affinity for LONP1. By contrast, the presence of artemisinins enhanced LONP1-CYP11A1 interaction, leading to the degradation of CYP11A1 by LONP1. A locate into mitochondria (55), making it possible to mediate the LONP1-CYP11A1 interaction. The androgen-lowering effect indicates
LONP1 as a promising target for hyperandrogenism intervention. LONP1 expression was decreased in the theca cells of PCOS as compared with levels in control, which could be a cause of the increased levels of CYP11A1 and androgens observed in PCOS. However, the inducer for the down-regulation of LONP1 in
PCOS remains unclear. LONP1 has been reported to decrease with age, oxidative stress,
and disuse muscle atrophy (56, 57). Additionally, its activity is largely attenuated during mitochondrial dysfunction (58). Thus, we speculate whether PCOS-related oxidative stress potentially lead to the down-regulation of
LONP1 expression or its activity. Additionally,

The off-target effects of artemisinins on other targets of LONP1. Furthermore, we discovered a proteolytic domain of LONP1 and defined resifor LONP1’s response to artemisinins. Indeed,
interaction between CYP11A1 and the proteolytic domain of LONP1 was augmented by artemisinins. However, the exact mechanism by which artemisinins reinforce the LONP1-CYP11A1 interaction remains unknown. We speculate that binding with artemisinins may induce conformational changes in LONP1 or modify LONP1 protein surface, allowing for enhanced interaction with CYP11A1. To test this hypothesis, a more detailed binding model of artemisininLONP1-CYP11A1 trimer will be needed.
Overall, we propose a model in which artemisinin derivatives protect against PCOS deproduction. Artemisinins directly target LONP1 and induce LONP1-CYP11A1 interaction, thereby promoting CYP11A1 degradation and subsequently inhibiting ovarian androgen synthesis.
Consequently, artemisinins show efficacy in and human patients. Conversely, the proandrogen inducer hCG inhibits the LONP1CYP11A1 association; additionally, LONP1 is down-regulated in PCOS, leading to upregulation of CYP11A1, which in turn promotes androgen production and exacerbates PCOS.
Our findings not only demonstrate the therbut also highlight their potential as molecularglue degraders. This discovery opens up aveby targeting the LONP1-CYP11A1 interaction.

For IP-MS analysis, HEK293T cells that stably expressed CYP11A1-3×Flag, as well as control cells, were divided into four groups as follows:
control cells treated with DMSO, CYP11A1-3×Flag cells treated with DMSO, CYP11A1-3×Flag cells treated with 5 mM ATM, and CYP11A1-3×Flag cells treated with 5 mM SM934 for 24 hours.
Each group of cells were lysed in co-IP lysis buffer and subjected to immunoprecipitation.
SDS-PAGE, and gels were cut into pieces for in-gel tryptic digestion. The tryptic peptides were then subjected to LC-MS/MS Analysis.
The resulting MS/MS data were processed using Proteome Discoverer 1.3. Tandem mass spectra were searched against human database. Trypsin/P was specified as cleavage enzyme allowing up to two missing cleavages.
Mass error was set to 10 ppm for precursor irons and 0.22 Da for fragment irons. Carbamidomethy1 on Cys were specified as fixed modification and oxidation on Met was specified as variable modification. Peptide confidence was set at high, and peptide ion score was set >20. The protein identified by MS in the CYP11A1-3×Flag cells represented potential candidates for interaction. To pinpoint artemisinin-responsive interacting proteins of
CYP11A1, we focused on proteins that were common between the two groups of CYP11A13×Flag cells treated with ATM and SM934. We
CYP11A1-3×Flag cells treated with DMSO. By applying this stringent criterion, we effectively narrowed down the candidate list. The potential CYP11A1 interacting proteins in IP-MS assay were then validated using co-IP.
